### 📊 **Research Summary: ChatGPT in Healthcare Decision-Making**

🔍 **Key Insights**:

1. 📈 ChatGPT initially lags in zero-shot scenarios but gains ground in few-shot scenarios.
2. 🧠 Incorporating domain-specific knowledge, such as XGB predictions, substantially boosts performance.
3. ⚠️ Higher rates of False Positives require careful model design and implementation.

🌟 **Summary**: 
> Our research dives deep into the role of OpenAI's ChatGPT in healthcare decision-making. While the model starts off trailing traditional ML approaches, it shows remarkable adaptability in few-shot learning scenarios. Domain-specific integration notably elevates its capabilities, at times outperforming classical ML models. However, caution is due—particularly due to increased rates of False Positives and variability in results.
