# ChatGPT-FairXAI
"ChatGPT-FairXAI" (short for Fair and eXplainable AI for CHATGPT) is an evaluation framework for assessing the fairness and explainability of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model in generating responses tailored specifically for Machine Learning tasks. This repository focuses on ML interpretability and fairness criteria applied to ML tasks under ChatGPT.

   <small><i>This paper provides preliminary insights from an ongoing larger project aiming to address the challenges associated with the use of LLMs, particularly in decision-making processes through prompt engineering. We demonstrate the ability to harness the potential of utilizing pre-trained models for downstream ML tasks, thereby eliminating the need for dedicated model training. By meticulously designing prompts that embody problem-specific instructions and contexts, we direct these models toward achieving desired objectives, such as enhancing prediction accuracy and minimizing risk (and/or mitigating unfair outcomes). Moreover, we underscore the significance of incorporating domain-specific knowledge from experts, obtained through an apriori ML phase, as a powerful tool to improve the quality and effectiveness of the prediction tasks to a considerable degree.</i></small></br>
