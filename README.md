# ChatGPT-FairXAI
"ChatGPT-FairXAI" (short for Fair and eXplainable AI for CHATGPT) is an evaluation framework for assessing the fairness and explainability of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model in generating responses tailored specifically for Machine Learning tasks. This repository focuses on ML interpretability and fairness criteria applied to ML tasks under ChatGPT.

This paper provides preliminary insights from an ongoing larger project aiming to address the challenges associated with the use of LLMs, particularly in decision-making processes through prompt engineering. We demonstrate the ability to harness the potential of utilizing pre-trained models for downstream ML tasks, thereby eliminating the need for dedicated model training. By meticulously designing prompts that embody problem-specific instructions and contexts, we direct these models toward achieving desired objectives, such as enhancing prediction accuracy and minimizing unfair outcomes. Moreover, we underscore the significance of incorporating domain-specific knowledge from experts, obtained through an apriori ML phase, as a powerful tool to improve the quality and effectiveness of the prediction tasks to a considerable degree.</i></small></br>
